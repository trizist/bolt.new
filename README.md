# Bolt.new: AI-Powered Full-Stack Web Development in the Browser

Bolt.new is an AI-powered web development agent that lets you prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser—no local setup required. If you’re here to build your own AI-powered web dev agent using the Bolt open-source codebase, [click here to get started](./CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## What Makes Bolt.new Different

While tools like Claude and v0 are incredible, they don’t let you install packages, run backends, or edit code directly. Bolt.new stands out with:

- **Full-Stack in the Browser**: Powered by StackBlitz’s WebContainers, Bolt.new integrates cutting-edge AI models with an in-browser development environment. You can:
  - Install and run npm tools and libraries (e.g., Vite, Next.js, and more)
  - Run Node.js servers
  - Interact with third-party APIs
  - Deploy to production from chat
  - Share your work via a URL

- **AI with Environment Control**: Unlike traditional dev environments where AI only assists with code generation, Bolt.new gives AI models complete control over the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to manage the entire app lifecycle—from creation to deployment.

Whether you’re an experienced developer, a product manager, or a designer, Bolt.new makes it easy to build production-grade full-stack applications. For developers interested in creating their own AI-powered tools with WebContainers, explore the open-source Bolt codebase in this repo!

## Tips and Tricks

Maximize your Bolt.new experience with these tips:

- **Be specific about your stack**: Mention frameworks or libraries (e.g., Astro, Tailwind, ShadCN) in your initial prompt to ensure Bolt scaffolds your project correctly.
- **Use the enhance prompt icon**: Click the 'enhance' icon before submitting your prompt to refine it with AI assistance, then tweak as needed.
- **Scaffold basics first, then add features**: Establish your app’s core structure before adding advanced functionality—this helps Bolt wire everything up properly.
- **Batch simple instructions**: Combine tasks like changing the color scheme, adding mobile responsiveness, and restarting the dev server into one prompt to save time and API credits.
